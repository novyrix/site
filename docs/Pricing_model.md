Novyrix Pricing Model: The Quotation Feature Logic
Here is the step-by-step logic for your calculator, broken down by service.

1. Website Development & Design
The calculator starts with a Base Price and adds Feature Blocks.

Base Price (e.g., KES 25,000): This covers a "Starter Site" — a 1-3 page, professionally designed, responsive website (Home, About, Contact) with an admin panel. This is your entry point.

The calculator then asks the client to choose their path:

Path A: "I'm not sure what I need" (Non-Tech) This path uses purpose-driven questions.

Question 1: What is the main goal of your website?

[ ] Inform Customers (Maps to: Base Price)

[ ] Showcase My Work (e.g., portfolio, photography) (Maps to: +Advanced Gallery Block, +KES 15,000)

[ ] Generate Leads (e.g., complex forms, blog) (Maps to: +Blog/CMS Block, +KES 15,000)

[ ] Sell Products Online (Maps to: +E-commerce Block, +KES 70,000)

[ ] Book Appointments (Maps to: +Booking System Block, +KES 25,000)

[ ] Run a Custom App (e.g., a SaaS) (Maps to: Redirects to Software Development)

Path B: "I know the features I want" (Tech) This path uses feature-driven questions.

Question 1: Select the features you need.

[ ] Standard Pages (5-10) (Maps to: Base Price)

[ ] Blog / Content Management System (CMS) (Maps to: +Blog/CMS Block, +KES 15,000)

[ ] Advanced Design Gallery/Portfolio (Maps to: +Advanced Gallery Block, +KES 15,000)

[ ] Booking & Appointment System (Maps to: +Booking System Block, +KES 25,000)

[ ] E-commerce (WooCommerce/Shopify) (Maps to: +E-commerce Block, +KES 70,000)

[ ] Payment Integration (M-Pesa, Stripe) (Maps to: Included in E-commerce Block)

[ ] API Integration (e.g., CRM, external data) (Maps to: +API Block, +KES 40,000)

Final Step (Hosting & Maintenance): After the project total is summed, you ask:

Question 2: How would you like to host your site?

[ ] Novyrix Basic Hosting: "Best for blogs and corporate sites." (+KES 3,900 / year)

[ ] Novyrix Advanced Hosting: "Best for e-commerce or apps." (+KES 5,800 / year)

[ ] I will manage my own hosting. (+KES 0)

Question 3: Add a "Novyrix Care Plan"? (Your Subscription!)

[ ] Yes, add Care Plan: "Monthly security, backups, updates, and 2 hours of support." (+KES 5,000 / month or +KES 50,000 / year)

[ ] No, I'll manage it myself. (+KES 0)

2. Software Development, Audit & Design
As you noted, this is harder to automate. The goal here is not to give a final quote, but to provide a Ballpark Estimate and sell a paid "Discovery Phase."

Question 1: What type of software do you need?

[ ] Mobile App (iOS/Android)

[ ] Web App / SaaS

[ ] Internal Business Tool (e.g., CRM, HRM, Portal)

[ ] I'm not sure.

Question 2: What is the current stage?

[ ] Idea Only (No design, no specs)

[ ] Have Designs (Figma/XD)

[ ] Have Full Technical Specs

Question 3: What key features are needed? (Select all that apply)

[ ] User Accounts & Login

[ ] Payments / Subscriptions

[ ] Admin Dashboard

[ ] Real-time Chat / Notifications

[ ] API Integrations

[ ] Reporting & Analytics

The "Quote" Result:

Your Ballpark Estimate: KES 800,000 - KES 1,500,000

Custom software is complex. This estimate is based on your initial selections.

Next Step: Project Discovery (KES 75,000) To give you a fixed, final-price quote, we need to complete a 2-week "Discovery Phase." We will map out every feature, create user flow diagrams, and define the full technical architecture. This ensures we build exactly what you need, with no surprises.

3. Workflow Automation
You are 100% correct: this is tricky and depends on the current setup. This calculator should not give a price. It should be a Qualification Funnel that ends by booking a call.

The goal is to see if the client is eligible and understands the value.

Question 1: What business area do you want to automate?

[ ] Sales (e.g., CRM, proposals, follow-ups)

[ ] Marketing (e.g., emails, social media, ads)

[ ] Operations (e.g., invoicing, onboarding, project management)

[ ] HR (e.g., hiring, leave requests)

Question 2: What tools are you already using? (Select all that apply)

[ ] Google Sheets / Excel

[ ] A CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce)

[ ] An Email Tool (e.g., Mailchimp)

[ ] A Project Tool (e.g., Trello, Asana)

[ ] We mostly use email and paper.

Question 3: How many hours per week does your team spend on repetitive, manual tasks (like copy-pasting data, sending reminder emails, etc.)?

[ ] 1-5 hours

[ ] 5-10 hours

[ ] 10-20 hours

[ ] 20+ hours

The "Quote" Result:

(If they chose 10+ hours and use some tools)

Result: You are a high-priority candidate for automation.

Based on your answers, you could save ~80 hours per month (KES X,XXX in value). Your current tools (like HubSpot and Google Sheets) are perfect for integration.

(If they chose < 5 hours or "email and paper")

Result: Let's build your foundation first.

Effective automation requires a digital foundation. Before we can automate your work, we may need to set up core tools like a CRM or project manager.

2. Software Development, Audit & Design
This calculator should be a "complexity checklist." The user's answers will place them into one of three pricing tiers.

Section 1: What is your project?
1. What are you looking to build?

[ ] Custom Business Software: "An internal tool to manage my team, inventory, or operations."

[ ] SaaS Application: "A web-based software for my customers to log into and use (e.g., a new subscription service)."

[ ] Mobile App (iOS/Android): "A native or hybrid app for the Apple App Store or Google Play Store."

[ ] Software Audit & Redesign: "I have existing software that is slow, buggy, or outdated, and I need a plan to fix or rebuild it."

(If they select "Software Audit & Redesign", skip to the 'Audit' path below. Otherwise, continue).

Section 2: The "Software Development" Path
2. What is the current stage of your project?

[ ] Idea: "I have a concept, but no designs or technical plans."

[ ] Designs Ready: "I have professional Figma/XD designs."

[ ] Full Specs: "I have a complete technical specification document."

3. What key features are essential? (Select all that apply) (Each selection adds "complexity points" in the background).

[ ] User Accounts & Login (includes roles like 'admin', 'user')

[ ] User Profiles & Dashboards

[ ] Payments (M-Pesa, Stripe, subscriptions)

[ ] Real-time Chat or Notifications

[ ] Advanced Reporting & Data Analytics

[ ] AI or Machine Learning features

[ ] Integration with other software (e.g., QuickBooks, HubSpot)

The "Software Development" Quote Result:
The calculator uses their answers to show one of these three results.

Result (Tier 1: Simple Internal Tool):

Ballpark Estimate: KES 400,000 - 900,000
Project Profile: This estimate is for a custom internal tool or a focused Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with 1-2 key features.

Your Fixed-Price Quote is One Step Away.

Custom software isn't like a website; every feature must be planned. To give you a final, fixed-price quote with no surprises, we must first complete a Project Discovery Phase.

Service: Novyrix Project Discovery Cost: KES 75,000 (One-time)

What you get:

4-6 workshop sessions with our team.

A complete User Flow & Feature Map.

Full Technical Architecture plan.

A guaranteed, fixed-price quote for the full build.

[ Button: Book Your KES 75,000 Discovery ]

(You would also create results for Tier 2 (Mid-Level SaaS / App) at KES 900,000 - 2,500,000 and Tier 3 (Complex / Enterprise) at KES 2,500,000+).

Section 2B: The "Software Audit" Path
If a user selects "Software Audit & Redesign", they are a very high-value lead. You shouldn't guess. You should sell them the audit directly.

Result: You Need a Software Audit

Running on old or buggy software costs you money every day in lost efficiency and security risks.

Before you can rebuild, you must have a plan. We must first perform a Technical Audit & Design Sprint to map out the exact problems and design the perfect solution.

Service: Novyrix Technical Audit Cost: KES 100,000 (One-time)

What you get:

Code & Security Audit: We review your current system for risks.

Performance & Database Analysis: We find every bottleneck.

New Solution Blueprint: We deliver a full technical plan and UI/UX prototype for the new, modern system.

A fixed-price quote to build the new system.

3. Workflow Automation
You are 100% correct: you can't quote this blind. The goal of this calculator is to qualify the client and show them you understand their pain. It should diagnose their problem and prescribe the solution.

The "Automation" Qualification Funnel
1. What area of your business feels the most "stuck" with manual work?

[ ] Sales: "e.g., Manually creating proposals, following up, entering data into a CRM."

[ ] Operations: "e.g., Invoicing, project tracking, onboarding clients."

[ ] Marketing: "e.g., Managing email lists, posting to social media."

[ ] HR: "e.g., Tracking leave requests, onboarding new staff."

2. What tools do you currently use to manage this work?

[ ] Mostly paper, Word documents, and basic email.

[ ] Spreadsheets (e.g., Google Sheets, Excel).

[ ] We have some digital tools (e.g., a CRM, Trello, Mailchimp) but they don't talk to each other.

[ ] We have advanced software (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce).

3. How many hours per week does your team spend on these manual tasks?

[ ] 1-5 hours (A small annoyance)

[ ] 5-15 hours (Getting painful)

[ ] 15+ hours (This is a major bottleneck)

The "Automation" Quote Result:
The calculator provides one of two "diagnoses" based on their answers.

Diagnosis 1: High-Priority Candidate (If they chose 15+ hours & use Spreadsheets/Digital Tools)

Diagnosis: You are a High-Priority Candidate for Automation.
Based on your answers, your team is losing over 60+ hours per month on tasks that can be automated.

Your existing tools (like Google Sheets and your CRM) are perfect for integration. We can build "bridges" between them to eliminate manual data entry, set up automatic reminders, and give you back valuable time.

Diagnosis 2: Needs Foundation First (If they chose "Paper & Email")

Diagnosis: Let's Build Your Foundation First.
Based on your answers, your main challenge is the lack of a central "source of truth." Effective automation is difficult because your information is trapped in paper and inboxes.

Before we can automate, we must first digitize your process.
