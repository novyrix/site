# 🤖 AI Consultant - Quick Start Guide

## What is the AI Consultant?

The **Novyrix AI Consultant** is an intelligent chatbot powered by **GPT-4 Turbo** that helps you build a custom, transparent quote for your project by having a natural conversation about your business needs.

It implements the "Vision Path" from your business playbook - perfect for clients who know **what they want to achieve** but not necessarily **how to build it**.

## 💬 Sample Conversations

### Scenario 1: E-Commerce Website

**You**: "I want to sell my handmade jewelry online"

**AI**: "That's a great business! We can definitely help you build an e-commerce platform. Our projects start with the **Core Foundation Package (KES 150,000)**, which includes your first 5 pages, security, and hosting setup.

To build your full quote, a few questions:

1. Will you need to accept M-Pesa payments from your customers?"

**You**: "Yes, M-Pesa is essential"

**AI**: "Perfect! I've added:
- Basic E-Commerce (KES 120,000)
- M-Pesa Integration (KES 30,000)

Next question: Should customers be able to create accounts to track their orders?"

**You**: "Yes, that would be good"

**AI**: "Great! Adding **User Authentication (KES 60,000)**.

Your current quote:
- Core Foundation: KES 150,000

### Scenario 2: KRA e-TIMS Automation

**You**: "I'm spending hours every day manually creating KRA invoices"

**AI**: "That's a critical compliance and time-sink issue. Our **Workflow Automation** service can eliminate this entirely with our **KRA e-TIMS Integration** workflow.

Our automation projects start at **KES 200,000** (Workflow Core Development), which covers:
- Process mapping workshop
- Secure environment setup
- Error monitoring
- Deployment

I've identified this relates to **KRA e-TIMS Integration**. To confirm the quote, what system do you currently use for your sales or invoices? (e.g., WooCommerce, QuickBooks, custom system)"

**You**: "We use WooCommerce"

**AI**: "Perfect. The quote for a custom workflow to connect your **WooCommerce site** directly to the **KRA e-TIMS API** would be:

- Workflow Core: KES 200,000
- KRA e-TIMS Integration: KES 100,000
- WooCommerce Connector: KES 40,000
**Total: KES 340,000**

This is a one-time build that will save you countless hours. This automation will:
✅ Automatically generate compliant invoices
✅ Eliminate manual data entry
✅ Ensure 100% KRA compliance

Would you like me to generate this formal quote and schedule a call?"
